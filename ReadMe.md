## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my fourth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-scripting-by-building-five-programs/build-five-programs) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting skills with Bash. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these 14 guided projects as part of this course are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the fourth of these projects I completed as part of this course, for my independent learning. 

## Programming With Bash 
For this project, I had to produce five Bash programs in various `.sh` files. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this task, I cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 220 Bash lessons. I created [in-depth notes when doing this, which are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-five-bash-programs-project-guided-course-notes.txt). This covered the creation of five project `.sh` programs. The first four of these shell files are below. These are clickable and listed in the chronological order which they were created in:
1. [`questionarire.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/questionnaire.sh) 
2. [`countdown.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/countdown.sh)
3. [`bingo.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/bingo.sh)
4. [`fortune.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/fortune.sh)

More information about each of these projects can be found in the [Bash notes I created when writing them](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-five-bash-programs-project-guided-course-notes.txt). These notes are in-depth and are organised according to the chronological convention listed above. The final shell file I produced as part of this project was [`five.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/five.sh). This is a single shell file, which executes all of these programs in conjunction when it is run. More information about this is in my [project Bash notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-Five-Bash-Programs-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-five-bash-programs-project-guided-course-notes.txt).
