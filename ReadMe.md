# Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my fifth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-sql-by-building-a-student-database-part-1/build-a-student-database-part-1) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting and SQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these 14 guided projects as part of this course are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the fifth of these projects I completed as part of this course, for my independent learning. 

## Programming With Bash 
For this project, I had to produce five Bash programs in various `.sh` files. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this task, I cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 140 Bash lessons. I created [in-depth notes when doing this, which are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-a-student-database-part-1-project-guided-course-notes.txt).
